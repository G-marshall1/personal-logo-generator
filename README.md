# personal-logo-generator

## Description

- I love making Logo's and design so creating a generator to do so was very exciting!
- I chose to create a SVG logo generator because I wanted to be able to quick multiple mock ups in quick succession 
- I desided to create a password generator to show how to implement node, inquirer, and jest to test and run a program.
- By making this I learned how important testing your code is before deploying and why we should push test driven development.
